    "*How many different paths can I possibly take to fulfill my degree requirements in time, and what would these paths look like?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every academic year, hundreds of first-year undergraduates at Stanford refer to the Bulletin, Stanford’s course catalog, to create their own ideal four-year plan. While this planning process may help students to gauge how much flexibility is allowed by their academic goals, many students come to realize that the plan itself is highly speculative. Because the times and availabilities of course offerings are subject to change year after year, it can be difficult to plan ahead - at least past the current academic year. In particular, there is a risk that a student who planned their courses meticulously may nonetheless fail to complete their degree requirements in time. Perhaps they were counting on a course being offered in a particular quarter, or perhaps the department’s requirements became unintentionally restrictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight, it is possible to assess the difficulty of completing a degree program given a set of constraints, based on publicly-available data from the Stanford Bulletin’s archives and associated websites (e.g. exploredegrees.stanford.edu and explorecourses.stanford.edu). With this information, we can identify all of the paths that were available to a student at any point in their undergraduate career, and note potential pitfalls and bottlenecks. Therefore, the goal of this project is not to predict the future; instead, the goal is to explore the full range of course paths that were allowed under a set of existing degree requirements, and in doing so, to inform broad-scale education initiatives at Stanford University.\n",

    "## 2. Features ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two features that are in the process of being integrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An exhaustive search of all possible ways to successfully complete a given set of degree requirements - the output of which produces a summary chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A function that returns the length of a *prerequisite chain* - that is, the number of courses that must precede any given course, based on the pre/corequisites listed in the descriptions of the 2015-2016 ExploreCourses course descriptions.\n",
    "\n",

    "# IV. Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Integration of the CoursePath and Prerequisite-Chain Length Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The CoursePath exhaustive search is computationally expensive, and soon becomes intractable with increases in either (i) the number of quarters over which to search or (ii) the number of courses relevant to the degree requirements. So far, it has only been possible to consider subsets of degree requirements over a relatively short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this shortcoming is due to the forward-search approach employed by the CoursePath analysis. Specifically, the CoursePath analysis runs an exhaustive search by choosing all possible course schedules in quarter 1, then appending all possible subsequent schedules in quarter 2, then appending all possible subsequent schedules in quarter 3, and so on, until quarter *T*. (Well, technically uses a depth-first search, but you get the idea.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient approach may involve an extension of the prerequisite-chain feature to search *backwards*. Such an approach may take the following broad steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate all possible course sets (i.e. courses taken by the student) that would satisfy the degree requirements.\n",
    "2. For each course set, construct a tree that represents the prerequisite-dependencies among the courses in the set. The **constraint.py** module in python_scripts may be useful for this step.\n",
    "3. For each course set, consider the *primary prerequisites* (made-up name; i.e. the courses that are not prerequisites to any other courses in the set). For each primary prerequisite, list the quarters in the course path where such a course could have been scheduled. (Surely no sooner than the length of the course's prerequisite chain.)\n",
    "4. Next, for each course set, consider the *secondary prerequisites* (i.e. the courses that are prerequisites to just *one* other course in the set). For each secondary prerequisite, list the quarters in the course path where such a course could have been scheduled.\n",
    "5. Et cetera, until the entire prerequisite tree has been explored.\n",
    "6. In the end, you will have generated a list of all possible course paths that satisfy the degree requirements. (Or will you? I'm not sure yet.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This project would require an error-free parsing of the prerequisite structures from the course descriptions in ExploreCourses. Unfortunately, this is the only place where prerequisite information is publicly available, and the descriptions are prone to both typos and non-standard writing formats.\n",
    "* I would recommend using the **constraint.py** module for this project, as it can be used to encode both degree requirements and course prerequisites. It may even be useful to extend the module to handle cases where one is required to \"choose two courses from a menu\" - for example."
