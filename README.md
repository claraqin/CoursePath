# Stanford Course Pathways Project

*How many different pathways can I possibly take to fulfill my degree requirements in time, and what would these pathways look like?*

Every autumn, hundreds of eager first-year undergraduates at Stanford refer to the Bulletin, Stanford’s course catalog, to create their own ideal four-year plan. While the planning process may help students to gauge how much flexibility is allowed by their academic goals, many students come to realize that the plans themselves are highly speculative. Because the meeting times and availabilities of course offerings are subject to change year after year, it can be difficult to plan ahead - at least past the current academic year. In particular, there is a risk that a student who planned their courses meticulously may nonetheless fail to complete their degree requirements in time. Perhaps they were counting on a course being offered in a particular quarter. Perhaps the department’s requirements were simply too restrictive.

In hindsight, however, it is possible to assess the difficulty of completing a degree program given a set of constraints, based on publicly-available data from the Stanford Bulletin’s archives and associated websites (e.g. ExploreDegrees.com).
